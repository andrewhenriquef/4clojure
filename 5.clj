;; Lists: conj
;; When operating on a list, the conj function will return a new list with one
;; or more items "added" to the front.
;; Note that there are two test cases, but you are expected to supply only one
;; answer, which will cause all the tests to pass.

;; Case tests
;; (= __ (conj '(2 3 4) 1))
;; (= __ (conj '(3 4) 2 1))

;; resolution
(1 2 3 4)
